# RaycastScanner

![](Documentation/Images/Image01.png)
 
## Description
Real-time geometry-based raycast system.

This is an attempt to recreate a Snowdrop Core Module called "BubbleSpace" in Unreal using C++.

It's an Actor Component that returns an average of the width around the player. It has both an Optimistic Metric and a Pessimistic Metric.
It can be used by Sound Designers to switch between ambiances, weather, weapon tails, modify parameters in real-time (for example reverb parameters).
